===========

To begin with, I'm not an export in this, not even an experienced programmer at all.

The key for me to do this in github instead of some public cloud storage is to inspire those who I write to with a better if not the best develop environment.
And also don't expect much Chinese here, as you'll need the ability to read English documentation sooner or later.


Getting started with PHP
========================
C is basic ,along side with html.
Eventhougt C isn't used to write web page, it will help you understand PHP better.

You can refer to http://www.w3s.com.cn/ most of the time, it's in Chinese!
Check advanced usage on http://php.net/ using search.
